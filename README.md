# Witchaven - PC Source code

Originally released [here](http://www.r-t-c-m.com/knowledge-base/downloads-rtcm/src-witchaven-source).

The repository is comprised of the content of the two released archives (see sections below).

## Original post (`whsrc.zip`)

> CAPSTONE GAMES SOURCE ARCHIVE
>
> The following files are provided as-is with no guarantee that they'll compile and build proper executables. The compiler used to build the code was Watcom C/C++ V9.5 or later. The target system was a 486 50+mhz running MS-DOS V5 or higher.
>
> These games were released by Capstone Software prior to them folding in 1996. As a former Capstone programmer this code was found in my archives and by popular demand I've decided to release it to the hobbyist community in hopes that the games will be revived. I do not own this code and I do not know who owns the copyrights to these games. To the best of my knowledge these games are abandon ware.

> The SETUP.EXE source code is present.

> Note: It's possible to compile the code, but there maybe some files or instructions missing as the game will not run without crashing.

## Original post (`WHAVENsrcsnap.7z`)
